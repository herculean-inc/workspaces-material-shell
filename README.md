# Workspaces Material Shell
A fork of [PapyElGringo's Material Shell](https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-shell) for use in Workspaces OS.

#### REQUIRES: gnome-shell >=3.32.0

## Installation
### From source
1) Clone the project to the gnome-shell extensions folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/herculean-inc/workspaces-material-shell.git /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/workspaces-material-shell@herculean-inc
```
2) Reload GNOME Shell:
  + On X.org: Hit `Alt+F2` and type the command `r`
  + On Wayland: Log out and back in
3) Open `gnome-tweaks` and activate the `Material Shell` extension **OR** enable it using 
```bash
gnome-extensions enable workspaces-material-shell@herculean-inc
```
